      The One Remaining Dementor
    </h1>
    <p>
      One dark night, in the forbidden forest, Voldemort and Wormtail were planning to write a story of death!
      But then the Ministry of Magic walked by...

    <p>
      Quickly they both ducked, Albus Dumbledore and Cornelius Fudge looked around for danger but they could not see any.
      So they went back to Hogwarts. Just then the dementors floated by, they looked around but they could only sense the tall trees.
      "I think they're gone now" said Wormtail but Wormtail was wrong, most of them had gone but one remained.
