      The One Remaining Dementor
    </h1>
    <p>
      One dark night, in the forbidden forest, Voldemort and Wormtail were planning to <u>write</u> a story of death!
      But then the Ministry of Magic walked by...

    <p>
      Quickly they <u>both</u> ducked, Albus Dumbledore and Cornelius Fudge looked around for danger but they <u>could</u> not see any.
      So they went back to Hogwarts. Just then the dementors floated by, they looked around but they <u>could only</u> sense the tall trees.
      "I think they're gone now" said Wormtail but Wormtail was <u>wrong, most</u> of them had gone but one remained.
